# Technologies Used
This project was created using React for the front end web page and, express, mongoose, and cors for development of the backend database. We also used the Google Books API. 
# Approach Taken
The approach taken from the backend was to quickly set up the database with all of the necessary routes and whitelists and then begin using curl requests to test that data could be added, sent, updated, and deleted. 
# Unsolved problems
One unsolved problem is user authentication.
